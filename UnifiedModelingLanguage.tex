\chapter{Unified Modeling Language}
\section{UML Data Modeling}
Data modeling means the way in which data is represented in applications. There are concrete models like relational model and XML model. But during the design phase, we tend to represent the data in a high-level model that can later be translated, usually automatically, into models specific to various implementations. Famous high-level design models include Entity-Relationship Model(E/R) and \textbf{Unified Modeling Language(UML)}, the latter of which is nowadays the mainstream model. It is a graphical model applied to both DB design and program design. We will focus on the data modeling subset of UML.

UML data modeling contains 5 concepts: classes, associations, association classes, subclasses, composition \& aggregation. 
\subsection{Class}
\textbf{Class} is a UML concept shared by data modeling and program design. It contains a \textbf{name}, a series of \textbf{attributes} and a series of \textbf{methods}. For the purpose of data modeling, we add the concept of \textbf{primary key(pk)} for the methods, and we don't need any method. Classes look a lot like relations and can be translated directly into relations. For our student application example, we will have a class \texttt{Student} with attributes \texttt{sId(pk),sName,GPA}, a class \texttt{College} with attributes \texttt{cName(pk),state}, as shown in Figure \ref{class}.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Association}
\textbf{Association} captures relationships between objects of two classes. For example, there can exist \texttt{Apply} relationship between \texttt{Student} and \texttt{College}, as shown in Figure \ref{association}.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{association.1}
\caption{Example of UML associations}\label{association}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Multiplicity} of an association specifies how many objects of class A can be related to an object of class B. In Figure \ref{association}, two multiplicities are marked: each student can apply for up to 5 colleges and must apply for at least one college, while each college takes no more than 20000 applications. If no upper limit exists, its position should be held by a \texttt{*}. \texttt{0..*} can be abbreviated as \texttt{*}, while \texttt{1..1} can be abbreviated as \texttt{1}. Concepts often used are one-to-one, many-to-one, one-to-many and complete associations. ``Complete'' means that all objects must be involved in the association, i.e. the lower limit is 1. If no multiplicity is specified, the default is \texttt{1..1}, i.e. complete one-to-one association.

Association can exist between a class and itself. For example, a college's main campus and its branches, students and their siblings, etc. 
\subsection{Association Class}
\textbf{Association classes} captures relationships with attributes between objects of two classes. For example, the \texttt{apply} relationship has attributes \texttt{date,decision}, as shown in Figure \ref{associationclass}. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{associationclass.1}
\caption{Example of UML association classes}\label{associationclass}
\end{figure}

A shortcoming of UML is that it cannot describe multiple associations between two objects that exist together, i.e. only one association can be captured between a pair of objects. In our example, if students can apply for the same college multiple times (e.g. for different majors), we can no longer use the association class \texttt{AppInfo}. A class \texttt{AppInfo} with separate relationships to students and colleges needs to be added. 

Note that if the multiplicity of an association is \texttt{1..1} or \texttt{0..1}, it is actually unnecessary to have an association class to capture its attributes: they can be moved into the object itself.  
\subsection{Subclass} 
\textbf{Subclass} provides description of inheritance relationship in UML. An example is given in Figure \ref{subclass}. Superclass \texttt{Student} has 3 subclasses: \texttt{ForeignS} for foreign students, \texttt{DomesticS} for domestic students, and \texttt{APStudent} for students who took AP courses. Each AP student can take 1-10 AP courses, and there is at least 1 student in each AP course.
\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics{subclass.1}
\caption{Example of UML subclasses}\label{subclass}
\end{figure}

In UML, superclass is called \textbf{generalization}, while subclass is called \textbf{specialization}. A subclass relationship is said to be \textbf{complete} if each instance of the superclass belongs to at least one subclass, otherwise it is said to be \textbf{incomplete/partial}. If each instance of the superclass belongs to at most one subclass, the subclass relationship is said to be \textbf{disjoint/exclusive}, otherwise it is said to be \textbf{overlapping}.
\subsection{Composition \& Aggregation}
\textbf{Composition} describes the relationship that objects of one class necessarily belong to objects of another class. If such belonging relationship is not necessary, it is called \textbf{aggregation}\footnote{Aggregation in UML has nothing to do with the aggregation functions in SQL.}. An example is provided in \ref{composition}. A college consists of a few departments, and each college can have a few apartments as its property, while an apartment does not have to belong to a college.

\section{UML to Relations}
Designed specified with UML can be translated into relations automatically provided that each ``regular'' class(i.e. not an association class, a subclass or a class contained in another class in a composite relationship) has a key. 
\subsection{Class}
Classes in UML can be translated directly into relations. Each attribute of the class becomes an attribute of the relation, and the primary key becomes the key attribute of the relation. The classes in Figure \ref{class} can be translated into 
\begin{lstlisting}
Student(sID,sName,GPA),
College(cName,state).
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Association}
Each association will be translated into its own relation that grabs the key from both sides of the association. The \texttt{Apply} association in Figure \ref{association} can be translated into 
\begin{lstlisting}
Apply(sID, cName).
\end{lstlisting}
The key of the generated relation depends on the multiplicity of the association. If we have \texttt{0..1} or \texttt{1..1} on one side of the association, then the primary key of the other side is the key of the relation generated from the association. Otherwise the key is the combination of the two primary keys.

Actually this relation may be not needed at all, depending on the multiplicity of the association. If we have \texttt{0..1} or \texttt{1..1} on one side of the association, the information can be folded into the relation generated from the class on the other side of the association. If we let the association in Figure \ref{association} have \texttt{0..1} on the right side, we can get rid of the \texttt{Apply} relation and change \texttt{Student} into
\begin{lstlisting}
Student(sID,sName,GPA,cName).
\end{lstlisting}
Actually even if we have \texttt{0..2} on the right side of the association, we can still get rid of \texttt{Apply} by changing \texttt{Student} into
\begin{lstlisting}
Student(sID,sName,GPA,cName1,cName2).
\end{lstlisting}
In the case of self association, the keys from both sides need to be renamed or indexed. For example, for the sibling association between two students, its schema is 
\begin{lstlisting}
Sibling(sID1,sID2).
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Association Class}
The relation generated from an association class is the relation generated from the association plus the attributes of the association class. For Figure \ref{associationclass}, the \texttt{Apply} relation becomes
\begin{lstlisting}
Apply(sID,cName,date,decision).
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Subclass}
There exist 3 commonly used translations for subclass relationship:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{ds1}Subclass relations contain superclass key and specialized attributes.
\item \label{ds2}Subclass relations contain all superclass attributes and specialized attributes.
\item \label{ds3}One relation contains all superclass attributes and subclass attributes. 
\end{enumerate}
The choice among the 3 options depends on properties of the relationship. If the subclasses are heavily overlapping, the design \ref{ds3} is preferable. If the subclasses are disjoint and complete, then design \ref{ds2} becomes the best choice. Let $sz1, sz2, sz3$ represent number of tuples in each design for s specific set of data, in general we have $sz3\leq sz2\leq sz1$, because design \ref{ds3} has one tuple for each object regardless of subclassing, design \ref{ds2} has one tuple for each object, plus one more each time an object is in more than one subclass, and design \ref{ds1} has one tuple for each object plus one more each time an object is in a subclass.

Note that subclasses are not considered as ``regular'' classes that must have a key for automatic translation. In fact a subclass inherits the key from its superclass.
\subsection{Composition \& Aggregation}
In a composition/aggregation relationship, we add the key of the container class into the relation of the contained class. In the case of aggregation, the key can be NULL. The composition \& aggregation relationship in Figure \ref{composition} results in the following relations:
\begin{lstlisting}
College(cName,state),
Department(dName,building,cName),
Apartment(apart#,nbUnits,cName).
\end{lstlisting}
Note that in a composite relationship, the relation generated from the contained class (e.g. \texttt{Department} above) is not considered as a ``regular'' class.
